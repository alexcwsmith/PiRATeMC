# Welcome to Pi-based Remote Acquisition Technology for Motion Capture (PiRATeMC) - version 0.1

#### This is primarily a local-area-network (LAN) based system for controlling a large number of Raspberry Pi video cameras simultaneously.

You can find the [operating systems and instructional videos here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y9IGVBCkBdnRykqMNaKmlipFwnT6WQuY?usp=share_link).
* **PiCamOS_cluster** is best for LAN use with several Pis.
* **PiCamOS_Standalone** is best for local use cases using only a single Pi at a time.



This works by configuring a 'remote controller' computer as a DHCP server to assign IP addresses, using a dedicated ethernet port or WiFi adapter.
